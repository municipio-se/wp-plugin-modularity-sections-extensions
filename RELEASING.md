# Release process

## 1.0.0 candidate

The plugin header is prepared for 1.0.0. This is an unreleased candidate until
its immutable tag and release have been published. Composer derives the version
from the Git tag; do not add a version field to composer.json.

Use independent SemVer for the documented settings, stored data, integration
points and behavior. Backward-incompatible changes require a major release,
compatible additions a minor release and compatible fixes a patch release.

## Compatibility and acceptance

The current integration target is WordPress 6.9.4, PHP 8.3 and the bundled
Modularity in Municipio theme 6.43.2, with modularity-sections 4.0.4. This is a
test target, not a claim that candidate reference acceptance has passed.
Preserve any earlier verified contracts described in README. Sections also
requires verification of the exact installed modularity-sections version. The
PHP ^8.2 Composer requirement does not mean every permitted platform combination
has been tested. Record exact dependencies and required upstream patches with
the acceptance evidence before extending support.

Verify the three documented field keys in an installation using Sections,
including save/reload and frontend preservation of formatted content. Use a
separate reference if the primary installation does not use Sections.

The pre-release suite passed on PHP 8.3.33 (4 tests / 17 assertions) on
2026-09-14. These are isolated tests and do not replace WordPress reference
acceptance. Existing lint diagnostics must be reviewed; a successful lint exit
is not a claim of zero warnings.

## Publication checklist

1. Review the final commit, changelog, plugin header and any asset-version
   constants. Run composer validate --strict, composer format, composer test and
   composer lint. Review formatting changes before committing.
2. Verify a fresh Composer installation and the supported upgrade paths in a
   named reference environment. Check shipped source, views, translations and
   assets where present; preserve saved content and unrelated behavior.
3. Obtain approval for the exact release commit and compatibility evidence. Only
   then publish an annotated 1.0.0 tag and matching GitHub release. Never move a
   published tag; corrections require a new version.
4. Verify Packagist indexes 1.0.0 and that Composer source and dist references
   equal the tag's peeled commit. If indexing fails, investigate the existing
   integration before requesting a manual update. Do not treat local candidate
   installation as proof of published distribution.
5. In each approved consumer, require
   municipio/wp-plugin-modularity-sections-extensions:^1.0, review the
   dependency diff, commit the lockfile, deploy after approval and repeat the
   relevant reference checks. Retain the previous lockfile and deployment
   reference for rollback.

## Rollback

No activation or write migration runs. Roll back the package and lockfile; raw
Section metadata remains intact.
